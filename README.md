# Car-prediction-model
This project focuses on predicting the price of a car based on multiple features such as brand, manufacturing year, engine capacity, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven using Machine Learning techniques.  A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on a synthetic dataset and used to predict car prices for new user inputs.
